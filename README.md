<h1 align="center">Gran Turismo 4 Blog</h1>
This is my first project ever using frontend tech.

## About
It's a simple blog with a recollection of personal experiences playing Gran Turismo 4, one of my favourite console games. It has some features:
* The site displays a tabular information about different events of the game.
* You can zoom a car's picture just by clicking/tapping it.
* Some sections have animations but they are optional.
* The last section offers a different style that I considered to be according to its theme.
